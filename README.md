R script to fetch pairwise comparison answers from a Google Form sheet and analyze them in order to obtain meaningful priorites for several criteria, as well as representative stakeholder types. Individuals belong to an initial set of stakeholders groups but can be automatically rearranged differently based on several criteria. The current script has been developed for assessing 11 criteria and needs to be adapted if the number of criteria changes. An R package is under development, which will adapt to the desired number of criteria, stakeholder types, etc. The scaling method for ranking preferences is based on a Likert-type scale, using a five levels bidirectional ordinal scale, with an equivalent number of negative and positive statements.
